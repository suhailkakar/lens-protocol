Let's be honest, creating a social media app from scratch is a bit of a challenge. You need to setup a database, a server, and a client and much more. Just like other social media apps, you need to create a user, post, and comment system. You would also need to manage the scalability and CDN.

But not anymore. With Lens Protocol you can create a social media app easily and quickly.

### What is Lens Protocol?

Lens Protocol is a composable and decentralized social graph, ready for you to build on so you can focus on creating a great experience, not scaling your users. Lens uses `postgres` as its database. The backend is written in Nodejs with TypeScript.
